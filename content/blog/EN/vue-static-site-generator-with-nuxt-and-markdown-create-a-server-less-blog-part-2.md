In [Part 1 of this article](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-1) we talked about what are static site generators and what are teh advantages of using them when working with Javascrip frameworks, we learned the basics of Nuxt, created our nuxt project anddadded a navbar and a footer component, learned how to use sass, and started to create our serverless blog using Markdown and FrontMatter. 

In this part we will keep building our blog, add internationalization, ........

## Internationalization with nuxt-i18n

I'll have the content of my blog posts written in separate files, one for EN and one for ES. And for the content of the home page and other small pieces of text, such as buttons or menu items, I'm going to use localization files where I'm going to store the text in English and its Spanish translation.

Let's create those localization files in a new folder called *locales* and add the translations in json objects. 

I'm going to use one single json file for each language because I don’t have a lot of text to translate. To organize those translations, I'm going to group them by area.

As I said in [Part 1 of this article](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-1) of this article, I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n" target="_blank">Nuxt-i18n </a>
 for the localization. Let me tell you why again: As the localization package I'm used to work with when creating Vuejs app its <a href="https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/" target="_blank">Vue.i18n</a>, my first though was to use it with this Nuxt app. But I found one main issue.  I want to add the language to the URL for my blog posts in order to have clean urls form which retrieving the language (something I 'll need in order to call the correct content when the user switches languages). With vue.i18n I have to do it manually, what is kind of a hazzle. However, *nuxt-i18n* provides a function to do this automatically. Other minor reason is that to use vue.i18n, you have to add it to your project as a plugin, so you have to create the plugin,  what it is not a big deal but if you can avoid doing it, much better.

So I decided to use *nuxt-i18n*, which is built on top of *vue-i18n* and solves those two problems for us. Let's install it with:

```npm i  nuxt-i18n```


Now we can register it as a module in *nuxtconfig.json*

``` javascript
   [
      'nuxt-i18n',
       { /* module options */ }
    ]

```

We add an array with the module name and the configuration.
We can directly create here the object with the options, but I prefer to add it in an external file for the sake of clarity.

I'm going to create the configuration file in the *locales* folder and import it to *nuxtconfig.json*.

```javascript
const i18nOptions = {
  useCookie: false,
  alwaysRedirect: true,
  locales: [
    {
      code: 'en',
      iso: 'en-US',
      name: 'English',
      file: 'content-en.json'
    },
    {
      code: 'es',
      iso: 'es-ES',
      name: 'Español',
      file: 'content-es.json'
    }
  ],
  lazy: true,
  seo: false,
  langDir: '/locales/',
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  parsePages: false
}
module.exports = {
  i18nOptions
}
```
One important thing here is to define our locales and reference the files where the translations will be placed.
