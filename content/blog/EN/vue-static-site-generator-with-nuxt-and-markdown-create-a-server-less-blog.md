## First Thoughts and The Nuxt-Markdown-FrontMatter-Netlify Stack

A couple of months ago, I decided to revamp my old website and I wanted to take the opportunity to learn about static site generators. After doing some research, I decided to go with the Vue-Nuxt-Markdown stack, and host my new site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I considered using a headless CMS or even creating my own API (which will be by natural way of doing it due to my strong backend developer background) but the idea of going totally serverless was very attractive to me, so I decided to use Markdown, which I was aware of but had never use it before.

My concern about using Markdown was that I wanted to integrate the content  written in Markdown into a Vue component. I knew I would need some webpack loader able to render .md files as Vue templates. After a little research I decided to use [Frontmatter](github.com/hmsk/frontmatter-markdown-loader) by [Kengo Hamasaki](https://hmsk.me/).

Another thing to consider was that my website should be in two languages (Spanish and English).

My first though was to use [Vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n) for the localization, but as I was planning to use .Nuxtjs, I did a little more research and found two drawbacks about using Vuei18n: 
- I would have to add it as a plugin, meaning I would have to create the plugin, which is not a big deal but if something I would have to do, and 
- In order to add the language to the URL, what I wanted to do in my blog posts, I would have to do it manually.

The good news is that I found [Nuxt-i18n](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n), which is built on top of Vue-i18n and solves those two problems for us.

If I didn’t needed to add the languages to the routes, I would probably stick with Vue-i18n, but as I wanted to do, Nuxt-i18n was a better choice, because it provides a function to do this automatically, which is very handy.

For the actual translation on the content, I decided to use a localization file to store basically the pieces of text for the home page, the buttons, and the menu items, and to create two separate pages, one for each language,  for the blog posts.


**Complete Project Code**: You can get the source code on [GitHub](https://www.netlify.com/)

**Prerequisits**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and Markdown.

**A note about Markdown**
I'm assuming you have a basic nowlegde about Markdown, but if you don't, don't worry. 
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is just a simple way to style content on the web. You can, for example, format text as bold or italics, create lists and headings, add images. You might be thinking 'like with HTML'... Yes, but keep in mind that Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. It only covers a  very small subset of HTML tags. It is mostly plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or * to add the formatting.

You can learn more about markdown and its syntax at the official page of its creator, 
[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or [in this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


## What are static sites and static site generators?

You probably are familiar with the distinction between static sites and dynamic sites, but let me explain the difference in case you need a refresher.

A **static website** consists of a series of HTML files, one for each page of your website. The content of each page is fixed (static). The content you add when you code your html page is the content that will be displayed.

A **dynamic website**, however,  uses server technologies (such as Java, Nodejs, c#, PHP ) to dynamically build a webpage on the fly when a user visits the corresponding URL, getting  the data it needs from a database.

Let's think on a blog, for example, you don't create a HTML page for each post and publish them as independent pages in your website; instead what you would usually do is create a dynamic site that contains the "template" for building a blog post, and when somebody browse the URL of one specific post, the page shown in the browser is built on the fly by filling the "template" with data from a database. This data is the title, content, and other info of the post, which was stored into de database when you created the post using your CMS.

This dynamic site approach works perfectly to build a blog, but if you want to  use  a Javascript framework like Vue, React or Angular in the front, you will face a big issue if you are concern about SEO, and we usually are.

### The poblem with Javascript frameworks and SEO

When we create or site usign a JavaScript framework, when a page is loaded in the browser, it is basically empty. **The content form the database will be loaded later**, after the JavaScript code is executed in the browser. This means that the Search Engines will probably miss the content when they visit your page, which will affect your ranking.

Here is where Static Site Generators come into rescue. [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/api/components-nuxt-link/) is one of them.

**With a Static Site Generator, the content is generated upfont**. When we build our app, Nuxtjs will process our javascript files and generate the corresponding html pages —if you have 50 posts, 50 html pages— and those static HTML pages is what will be served when a visitor browse our blog. 


**Server Site Rendering** in another solution for the same rendering problem. In that case, the static pages will be generated, no when we build the app but in the server. The server calls for the content and renders the static pages when it gets the content, before serving them.

For my blog (and for this posts) I'm going to focus in Static Site Generators because I want to take advantage of one characteristic they have:  **you don't need a server if you store your content in markdown files**. And this is what I'm going to do.

### Let's summarize some of the advantages our site will have:

- We don’t need a server
- We can host our website free on sites like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [GithubPage](https://pages.github.com/)
- Blazing fast site
- SEO friendly

## Brief Intro to Nuxt

[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/api/components-nuxt-link/)  is a framework built on top of Vue. It adds additional features to Vue, like:
- Static Site Generation
- Server Site Rendering
- Adding metatags to our pages
- VueRouter out of the box
- Vuex support
- Automatic Route Handling: Nuxt.js  will automatically create the routes based on the files and folders in the "pages" directory
- Code-Sppliting to make your app render faster by breaking the JavaScript containing our app into multiple javascipt files in the server and serving only the JavaScript needed for each page
- Production ready configuration to make your deploy to Production easier.

### Structure of a Nuxt Project
The structure of a Nuxt project will be a little different form that of a Vue project
