In [Part 1 of this article](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-1) we talked about what are static site generators and what are teh advantages of using them when working with Javascrip frameworks, we learned the basics of Nuxt, created our nuxt project anddadded a navbar and a footer component, learned how to use sass, and started to create our serverless blog using Markdown and FrontMatter. 

In [Part 2 ](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-2) we saw how to add internationalization to our static site —including the blog— using "Nuxt-i18n". 

In [Part 3 ](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-3) I show you how to create a home page like the one in this site.

In [Part 4 ](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-4) we finished our blog pages, adding some final touches like search and filter funcionality and pagination.

In this final part, I'm going to build the production files and deploy the site to  <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.


**Index**

- [Creating the Production Files](#dist)
- [Deploying to Netlify](#deploy)


**Complete Project Code**: You can get the source code on <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n" target="_blank">GitHub </a>

**Prerequisits**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and Markdown.

## Creating the Production Files

We need to build our application for production. When creating static sites with only static routes, we run ```npm run generate``` and that's all. This command will create a *dist* folder ready to be deployed.


But as we have dynamic routes for our posts we need to do a little configuration to define our dynamic routes. We need one route for each of our posts, and we have to specify them in the *nuxt.config.json* file, in the *generate* property. Something like:

```javascript
generate: {
  routes: [
  'blog/post1',
  'blog/post2',
  ...
]
```

<br/>
You can add the routes manually if you have few posts, but I preffer to do it programatically.

This is how I finally did it:

In *nuxt.config.json* I created a method to get the name of all the *.md* files in the *content/blog* folder. Then, I will create the routes using this filename, which is the same that the blog slug.

The code is pretty straight forward. I'm using path and fs to access the directory where the .md files are and get the filename, which I'm using to create the routes, both for English and Spanish. 

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs')

const getDynamicRoutes = function() {
  const postsDirEN = path.join(__dirname, '/content/blog/EN');
  const postsFilesEN = fs.readdirSync(postsDirEN);

  const postsDirES = path.join(__dirname, '/content/blog/ES')
  const postsFilesES = fs.readdirSync(postsDirES)

   // map the contentFiles to get an array of objects instead of an array od string,
   // which is provided by fs.readdirSync(contentDir)
   const routesEN = postsFilesEN.map(filename => {
    return {
      route: `/blog/${path.basename(filename, '.md')}`,
      //payload: fs.readFileSync(path.join(postsDir, filename))
    }
  });

  const routesES = postsFilesES.map(filename => {
    return {
      route: `es/blog/${path.basename(filename, '.md')}`,
    }
  });

  return routesEN.concat(routesES);

}
```

And the only remaining thing is to build the production files and deploy them to Netlify. Let's see how to doit in [Part 5](vue-static-site-generator-with-nuxt-and-markdown-create-a-server-less-blog-part-5)
